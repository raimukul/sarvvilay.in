              Following a lifecycle approach, Our Foundation, among the top NGO
              in India, works intensively through focused welfare projects in
              four major areas â€“ child education for poor children, healthcare
              for families, skills training and livelihood for youth, and
              community engagement through women empowerment. So far, we have
              been able to directly impact the lives of over 1 million children
              and families.
